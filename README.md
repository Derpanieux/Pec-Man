# Pec-Man
Pac-Man is a game that is pretty much a carbon copy of Pec-Man, except with a non-bodybuilder theme.
The goal of Pec-Man is to get as many gains as possible. Gains are gotten by collecting benches and weights. Gains are lost when Pec-Man runs into a treadmill, because cardio __WILL__ steal all your gains. When Pec-Man collects Protein WAy, he temporarily becomes strong enough to dismantle treadmills. The pure strength assosiated with tearing up treadmills gives him more gains. khaled does not know ap computer science.
