# Pec-Man
Pac-Man is a game that is pretty much a carbon copy of Pec-Man, except with a non-bodybuilder theme.
The goal of Pec-Man is to get as many gains as possible. Gains are gotten by collecting weights. Gains are lost when Pec-Man runs into a treadmill, because cardio __WILL__ steal all your gains. When Pec-Man collects Protein WHEY, he gets a score boost. The pure strength assosiated with the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate Whey Protein Powder\* gives him more gains.
